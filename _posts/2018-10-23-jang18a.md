title: 'Grasp2Vec: Learning Object Representations from Self-Supervised Grasping'
abstract: 'Well structured visual representations can make robot learning faster and
  can improve generalization. In this paper, we study how we can acquire effective
  object-centric representations for robotic manipulation tasks without human labeling
  by using autonomous robot interaction with the environment. Such representation
  learning methods can benefit from continuous refinement of the representation as
  the robot collects more experience, allowing them to scale effectively without human
  intervention. Our representation learning approach is based on object persistence:
  when a robot removes an object from a scene, the representation of that scene should
  change according to the features of the object that was removed. We formulate an
  arithmetic relationship between feature vectors from this observation, and use it
  to learn a representation of scenes and objects that can then be used to identify
  object instances, localize them in the scene, and perform goal-directed grasping
  tasks where the robot must retrieve commanded objects from a bin. The same grasping
  procedure can also be used to automatically collect training data for our method,
  by recording images of scenes, grasping and removing an object, and recording the
  outcome. Our experiments demonstrate that this self-supervised approach for tasked
  grasping substantially outperforms direct reinforcement learning from images and
  prior representation learning methods. '
