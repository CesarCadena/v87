title: Learning Deployable Navigation Policies at Kilometer Scale from a Single Traversal
abstract: 'Model-free reinforcement learning has recently been shown to be effective
  at learning navigation policies from complex image input. However, these algorithms
  tend to require large amounts of interaction with the environment, which can be
  prohibitively costly to obtain on robots in the real world. We present an approach
  for efficiently learning goal-directed navigation policies on a mobile robot, from
  only a single coverage traversal of recorded data. The navigation agent learns an
  effective policy over a diverse action space in a large heterogeneous environment
  consisting of more than 2km of travel, through buildings and outdoor regions that
  collectively exhibit large variations in visual appearance, self-similarity, and
  connectivity. We compare pretrained visual encoders that enable precomputation of
  visual embeddings to achieve a throughput of tens of thousands of transitions per
  second at training time on a commodity desktop computer, allowing agents to learn
  from millions of trajectories of experience in a matter of hours. We propose multiple
  forms of computationally efficient stochastic augmentation to enable the learned
  policy to generalise beyond these precomputed embeddings, and demonstrate successful
  deployment of the learned policy on the real robot without fine tuning, despite
  environmental appearance differences at test time. The dataset and code required
  to reproduce these results and apply the technique to other datasets and robots
  is made publicly available at rl-navigation.github.io/deployable. '
