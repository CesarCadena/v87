title: 'HDNET: Exploiting HD Maps for 3D Object Detection'
abstract: 'In this paper we show that High-Definition (HD) maps provide strong priors
  that can boost the performance and robustness of modern 3D object detectors. Towards
  this goal, we design a single stage detector that extracts geometric and semantic
  features from the HD maps. As maps might not be available everywhere, we also propose
  a map prediction module that estimates the map on the fly from raw LiDAR data. We
  conduct extensive experiments on KITTI [1] as well as a large-scale 3D detection
  benchmark containing 1 million frames, and show that the proposed map-aware detector
  consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art in both mapped and un-mapped scenarios.
  Importantly the whole framework runs at 20 frames per second. '
