title: Unpaired Learning of Dense Visual Depth Estimators for Urban Environments
abstract: 'This paper addresses the classical problem of learning-based monocular
  depth estimation in urban environments, in which a model is trained to directly
  map a single input image to its corresponding depth values. All currently available
  techniques treat monocular depth estimation as a regression problem, and thus require
  some sort of data pairing, either explicitly as input-output ground-truth pairs,
  using information from range sensors (i.e. laser), or as binocular stereo footage.
  We introduce a novel methodology that completely eliminates the need for data pairing,
  only requiring two unrelated datasets containing samples of input images and output
  depth values. A cycle-consistent generative adversarial network is used to learn
  a mapping between these two domains, based on a custom adversarial loss function
  specifically designed to improve performance on the task of monocular depth estimation,
  including local depth smoothness and boundary equilibrium. A wide range of experiments
  were conducted using a variety of well-known indoor and outdoor datasets, with depth
  estimates obtained from laser sensors, RGBD cameras and SLAM pointclouds. In all
  of them, the proposed CycleDepth framework reaches competitive results even under
  a more restricted training scenario. '
