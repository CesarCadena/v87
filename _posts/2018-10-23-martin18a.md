title: Sparse Gaussian Process Temporal Difference Learning for Marine Robot Navigation
abstract: 'We present a method for Temporal Difference (TD) learning that addresses
  several challenges faced by robots learning to navigate in a marine environment.
  For improved data efficiency, our method reduces TD updates to Gaussian Process
  regression. To make predictions amenable to online settings, we introduce a sparse
  approximation with improved quality over current rejection-based methods. We derive
  the predictive value function posterior and use the moments to obtain a new algorithm
  for model-free policy evaluation, SPGP-SARSA. With simple changes, we show SPGP-SARSA
  can be reduced to a model-based equivalent, SPGP-TD. We perform comprehensive simulation
  studies and also conduct physical learning trials with an underwater robot. Our
  results show SPGP-SARSA can outperform the state-of-the-art sparse method, replicate
  the prediction quality of its exact counterpart, and be applied to solve underwater
  navigation tasks. '
