title: Model-Based Reinforcement Learning via Meta-Policy Optimization
abstract: 'Model-based reinforcement learning approaches carry the promise of being
  data efficient. However, due to challenges in learning dynamics models that sufficiently
  match the real-world dynamics, they struggle to achieve the same asymptotic performance
  as model-free methods. We propose Model-Based Meta-Policy-Optimization (MB-MPO),
  an approach that foregoes the strong reliance on accurate learned dynamics models.
  Using an ensemble of learned dynamic models, MB-MPO meta-learns a policy that can
  quickly adapt to any model in the ensemble with one policy gradient step. This steers
  the meta-policy towards internalizing consistent dynamics predictions among the
  ensemble while shifting the burden of behaving optimally w.r.t. the model discrepancies
  towards the adaptation step. Our experiments show that MB-MPO is more robust to
  model imperfections than previous model-based approaches. Finally, we demonstrate
  that our approach is able to match the asymptotic performance of model-free methods
  while requiring significantly less experience. '
