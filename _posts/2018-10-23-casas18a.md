title: 'IntentNet: Learning to Predict Intention from Raw Sensor Data'
abstract: 'In order to plan a safe maneuver, self-driving vehicles need to understand
  the intent of other traffic participants. We define intent as a combination of discrete
  high level behaviors as well as continuous trajectories describing future motion.
  In this paper we develop a one-stage detector and forecaster that exploits both
  3D point clouds produced by a LiDAR sensor as well as dynamic maps of the environment.
  Our multi-task model achieves better accuracy than the respective separate modules
  while saving computation, which is critical to reduce reaction time in self-driving
  applications. '
