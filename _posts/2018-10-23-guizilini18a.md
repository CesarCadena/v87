title: Fast 3D Modeling with Approximated Convolutional Kernels
abstract: 'This paper introduces a novel regression methodology for 3D reconstruction,
  with applications in robotics tasks such as terrain modeling and implicit surface
  calculation. The proposed methodology is based on projections into a high-dimensional
  space, that is able to fit arbitrarily complex data as a continuous function using
  a series of kernel evaluations within a linear regression model. We avoid direct
  kernel calculation by employing a novel sparse random Fourier feature vector, that
  approximates any shift-invariant kernel as a series of dot products relative to
  a set of inducing points placed throughout the input space. The varying properties
  of these inducing points produce non-stationarity in the resulting model, and can
  be jointly learned alongside linear regression weights. Furthermore, we show how
  convolution with arbitrary kernels can be performed directly in this high-dimensional
  continuous space, by training a neural network to learn the Fourier transform of
  the convolutional output based on information from the input kernels. Experimental
  results in terrain modeling and implicit surface calculation show that the proposed
  framework is able to outperform similar techniques in terms of computational speed
  without sacrificing accuracy, while enabling efficient convolution with arbitrary
  kernels for tasks such as global localization and template matching within these
  applications. '
