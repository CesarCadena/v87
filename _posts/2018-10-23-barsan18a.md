title: Learning to Localize Using a LiDAR Intensity Map
abstract: 'In this paper we propose a real-time, calibration-agnostic and effective
  localization system for self-driving cars. Our method learns to embed the online
  LiDAR sweeps and intensity map into a joint deep embedding space. Localization is
  then conducted through an efficient convolutional matching between the embeddings.
  Our full system can operate in real-time at 15Hz while achieving centimeter level
  accuracy across different LiDAR sensors and environments. Our experiments illustrate
  the performance of the proposed approach over a large-scale dataset consisting of
  over 4000km of driving. '
