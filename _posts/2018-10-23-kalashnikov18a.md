title: Scalable Deep Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Based Robotic Manipulation
abstract: 'In this paper, we study the problem of learning vision-based dynamic manipulation
  skills using a scalable reinforcement learning approach. We study this problem in
  the context of grasping, a longstanding challenge in robotic manipulation. In contrast
  to static learning behaviors that choose a grasp point and then execute the desired
  grasp, our method enables closed-loop vision-based control, whereby the robot continuously
  updates its grasp strategy based on the most recent observations to optimize long-horizon
  grasp success. To that end, we introduce QT-Opt, a scalable self-supervised vision-based
  reinforcement learning framework that can leverage over 580k real-world grasp attempts
  to train a deep neural network Q-function with over 1.2M parameters to perform closed-loop,
  real-world grasping that generalizes to 96% grasp success on unseen objects. Aside
  from attaining a very high success rate, our method exhibits behaviors that are
  quite distinct from more standard grasping systems: using only RGB vision-based
  perception from an over-the-shoulder camera, our method automatically learns regrasping
  strategies, probes objects to find the most effective grasps, learns to reposition
  objects and perform other non-prehensile pre-grasp manipulations, and responds dynamically
  to disturbances and perturbations. '
