title: Personalized Dynamics Models for Adaptive Assistive Navigation Systems
abstract: Consider an assistive system that guides visually impaired users through
  speech and haptic feedback to their destination. Existing robotic and ubiquitous
  navigation technologies (e.g., portable, ground, or wearable systems) often operate
  in a generic, user-agnostic manner. However, to minimize confusion and navigation
  errors, our real-world analysis reveals a crucial need to adapt theinstructional
  guidance across different end-users with diverse mobility skills. To address this
  practical issue in scalable system design, we propose a novel model based reinforcement
  learning framework for personalizing the system-user interaction experience. When
  incrementally adapting the system to new users, we propose to use a weighted experts
  model for addressing data-efficiency limitations in transfer learning with deep
  models. A real-world dataset of navigation by blind users is used to show that the
  proposed approach allows for (1) more accurate long-term human behavior prediction
  (up to 20 seconds into the future) through improved reasoning over personal mobility
  characteristics, interaction with surrounding obstacles, and the current navigation
  goal, and (2) quick adaptation at the onset of learning, when data is limited.
