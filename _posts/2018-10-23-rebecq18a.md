title: 'ESIM: an Open Event Camera Simulator'
abstract: Event cameras are revolutionary sensors that work radically differently
  from standard cameras. Instead of capturing intensity images at a fixed rate, event
  cameras measure changes of intensity asynchronously, in the form of a stream of
  events, which encode per-pixel brightness changes. In the last few years, their
  outstanding properties (asynchronous sensing, no motion blur, high dynamic range)
  have led to exciting vision applications, with very low-latency and high robustness.
  However, these sensors are still scarce and expensive to get, slowing down progress
  of the research community. To address these issues, there is a huge demand for cheap,
  high-quality synthetic, labeled event for algorithm prototyping, deep learning and
  algorithm benchmarking. The development of such a simulator, however, is not trivial
  since event cameras work fundamentally differently from frame-based cameras. We
  present the first event camera simulator that can generate a large amount of reliable
  event data. The key component of our simulator is a theoretically sound, adaptive
  rendering scheme that only samples frames when necessary, through a tight coupling
  between the rendering engine and the event simulator. We release an open source
  implementation of our simulator.
